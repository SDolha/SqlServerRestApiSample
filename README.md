# SqlServerRestApiSample
If you have a SQL Server database and you would like to expose data through a REST API over the Web, you can easily do that using Visual Studio as allows you to:
 * generate Entity Framework model classes for selected entities of the database schema;
 * add WebAPI controllers with create, read, update, and delete operations already implemented using REST style for selected model classes.

Moreover, third party Swashbuckle package allows you to seamlessly document your API and use its user interface as a test client.
